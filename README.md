# LudumDare42

Ludum dare is a game development competition where people from all around the world are challenged to build an entire game. Ludum dare has 2 categories: Compo (alone, 48 hour limit) and Jam (alone or multiple people, 72 hour limit) and I decided to join the Compo category to try out what I learned about unity in school.

My ludum dare project called "The Pit". For my project page from the competition, view https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/the-pit

The project I made isn't the cleanest unity project you will find, but overall I am quite proud of how it turned out with the time I got in the competition. The part I am the most happy with is tweaking the unity physics so that the player movements would be translated into game asset pixels (1/32 unit instead of unity's way smaller increments in movement) to make the movement feel more pixelated and old school.
