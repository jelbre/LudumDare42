# LudumDare42

Ludum dare is a game development competition where people from all around the world are challenged to build an entire game. Ludum dare has 2 categories: Compo (alone, 48 hour limit) and Jam (alone or multiple people, 72 hour limit) and I decided to join the Compo category to try out what I learned about unity in school.

My ludum dare project called "The Pit". For my project page from the competition, view https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/the-pit
